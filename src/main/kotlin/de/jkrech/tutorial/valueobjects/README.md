# Value objects

Value objects are a way to represent immutable data in Kotlin. They are often used to encapsulate a set of related values that should be treated as a single unit. Value objects can help improve code readability and maintainability by providing a clear structure for data.

* Example of a value object: See [VeryImportantId](VeryImportantId.kt)
* Use of a value object: See [Tutorial](Tutorial01.kt)

The init method can be used to validate the values: See [ISBN](Isbn.kt)
